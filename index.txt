PoshC2 is a proxy aware C2 framework used to aid penetration testers with red teaming, post-exploitation and lateral movement.

PoshC2 is primarily written in Python3 and follows a modular format to enable users to add their own modules and tools, allowing an extendible and flexible C2 framework. Out-of-the-box PoshC2 comes PowerShell/C# and Python3 implants with payloads written in PowerShell v2 and v4, C++ and C# source code, a variety of executables, DLLs and raw shellcode in addition to a Python3 payload. These enable C2 functionality on a wide range of devices and operating systems, including Windows, *nix and OSX.

Other notable features of PoshC2 include:

* Consistent and Cross-Platform support using Docker.
* Highly configurable payloads, including default beacon times, jitter, kill dates, user agents and more.
* A large number of payloads generated out-of-the-box which are frequently updated and maintained to bypass common Anti-Virus products.
* Auto-generated Apache Rewrite rules for use in a C2 proxy, protecting your C2 infrastructure and maintaining good operational security.
* A modular format allowing users to create or edit C#, PowerShell or Python3 modules which can be run in-memory by the Implants.
* Notifications on receiving a successful Implant, such as via text message or Pushover.
* A comprehensive and maintained contextual help and an intelligent prompt with contextual auto-completion, history and suggestions.
* Fully encrypted communications, protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the C2 traffic even when communicating over HTTP.
* Client/Server format allowing multiple team members to utilise a single C2 server.
* Extensive logging. Every action and response is timestamped and stored in a database with all relevant information such as user, host, implant number etc. In addition to this the C2 server output is directly logged to a separate file.
* PowerShell-less implants that do not use System.Management.Automation.dll using C# or Python.
* A free and open-source SOCKS Proxy by integrating with SharpSocks

PoshC2 is fully open source and available on GitHub here: https://github.com/nettitude/PoshC2/

#######
Install
#######

PoshC2 can be installed on any system with Python3 installed, however it is only commonly tested on Debian based Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu and Kali Linux.
These operating systems are also free and open source and for the most reliable experience it is recommended that PoshC2 in this way, from a VPS or Virtual Machine if required.

It is recommended to add an exclusions folder for any host-based Anti-Virus for the PoshC2 install directory and project directory.

You can install PoshC2 directly or use the Docker images, instructions for both are below.

.. code-block:: bash
    *** PoshC2 Install script ***
    Usage:
    ./Install.sh -b <git branch> -p <Directory to clone PoshC2 to>

    Defaults are master branch to /opt/PoshC2

Elevated privileges are required as the install script performs `apt` updates and installations.

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nettitude/PoshC2/master/Install.sh | sudo bash


You can manually set the PoshC2 installation directory by passing it to the Install.sh script as the `-p` argument. The default is **/opt/PoshC2**:

.. code-block:: bash
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nettitude/PoshC2/master/Install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -p /root/PoshC2


*********************
Cutting Edge features
*********************

We want to keep the `master` branch stable to ensure that users are able to rely on it when required and for this reason changes can often be feature-complete but not yet present on `master` as they have not been tested completely and signed-off yet.

If you want to look at upcoming features in PoshC2 you can check out the `dev` branch, or any individual feature branches branched off of `dev`.

As features **are** tested before they are merged into `dev` this branch should still be fairly stable and operators can opt in to using this branch or a particular feature branch for their engagement.
This does trade stablity for new features however so do it at your own discretion.

To use `dev` or a feature branch pass the branch name to the Install.sh script as the `-b` argument:

.. code-block:: bash
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nettitude/PoshC2/dev/Install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -b dev


Note the URL includes the branch name also (here `dev` instead of `master`).

#####################
Installing for Docker
#####################

You can also run PoshC2 using Docker, this allows more stable and running and enables PoshC2 to easily run on other operating systems.

This script does not clone PoshC2 as the PoshC2 images on Docker Hub are used, so only a minimal install of some dependencies and scripts are performed.

To start with, install Docker on the host and then add the PoshC2 projects directory to Docker as a shared directory if required for your OS. By default this is **/var/poshc2** on *nix.

****************
Kali based hosts
****************

Python3 install script:

.. code-block:: bash
    *** PoshC2 Install script for Docker ***
    Usage:
    ./Install.sh -b <git branch>

    Default is the master branch


Elevated privileges are required as the install script performs `apt` updates and installations.

.. code-block:: bash
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nettitude/PoshC2/master/Install-for-Docker.sh | sudo bash


To use the `dev` or feature branches with Docker curl down the `Install-for-Docker.sh` on the appropriate branch and pass the branch name as an argument:

.. code-block:: bash
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nettitude/PoshC2/BRANCHNAME/Install-for-Docker.sh | sudo bash -s -- -b BRANCHNAME


*********
Other OSs
*********

On other *nix flavours and MacOS, copy the posh-docker\* commands to your path.
On Windows, import the PoshC2.psm1 PowerShell module.
