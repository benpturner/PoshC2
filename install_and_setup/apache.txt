  Apache Rewrite Rules
#########################

It is recommended to use a C2 Proxy to maintain operational security by proxying all traffic to the C2 Server. A simple VPS running `Apache <https://httpd.apache.org/>`_ can be stood up and `mod_rewrite <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html>`_ used to silently redirect traffic from the proxy to the C2 Server without the client knowing, allowing the red team to keep their C2 infrastructure hidden and allowing flexibility should the proxy IP be compromised.

A typical example could look like this:

.. image:: ./proxy.png
    :width: 777
    :align: center


This provides operational security by not exposing the C2 infrastructure to the target or the internet at large, and allows the red team to pivot onto a different C2 proxy if the existing one is compromised, without the need to change the C2 server itself.

Using Apache Rewrite rules we can redirect traffic that is intended for the C2 server but also retain a fully functional web site on the same host that does not hit our Rewrite Rules, so that if bots, unrelated browsers or the blue-team come a-lookin' they are only served a benign website.

To help explain this Nettitude created a short blog which explains one way of achieving this using a VPS with OpenVPN:

Setup
*****

Once you've setup a VPS you will need to configure Apache to rewrite your C2 traffic back to the C2 Server instance. The example below details a typical example:

You will need to install Apache HTTPd and enable some modules before running the webserver:

.. code-block::  bash

    apt-get install apache2
    a2enmod ssl
    a2enmod rewrite
    a2enmod proxy
    a2enmod proxy_http
    a2enmod headers

As part of the C2 Server's bootstrap process when it first launches for a new project it generates a **rewrite-rules.txt** file with the required rules for that C2 server for the Apache configuration.
We then place the rules within your Apache configuration file for relevant virtual hosts:

.. code-block::  bash

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html
        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
    </VirtualHost>

    <IfModule mod_ssl.c>
        <VirtualHost _default_:443>
            RewriteEngine On
            SSLProxyEngine On
            SSLProxyCheckPeerCN Off
            SSLProxyVerify none
            SSLProxyCheckPeerName off
            SSLProxyCheckPeerExpire off

    </IfModule>

Any C2 URLs that match these rules will therefore be rewritten to the C2 Server. Any that do not match these URLs will instead be served content from the usual DocumentRoot, in this case **/var/www/html**.

****************
Apache Whitelist
****************
When performing a Red Team engagement, it is imperative that your C2 infrastructure be sufficiently locked down and should only allow implants from the correct IP address range of the Customer. This is known as whitelisting.

To add a whitelist to the C2 Proxy, create a file with all the IP addresses that are known to be the client. There is a slight nuance with Apache as the file format is the below:

.. code-block:: bash

    10.0.0.1 –
    10.0.0.2 –

This Python script will help convert a IP CIDR range into the correct format for Apache:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/python
    from netaddr import IPNetwork
    import sys

    for ip in IPNetwork("10.10.0.0/21"):
        print '%s -' % ip

Once you have the whitelist, you can use the **RewriteMap** function to add the IP address list for use in rewrite conditions.
Below is a simple Rewrite Rule which will respond to the client with a 404 Not Found response if the requesting IP is not in the whitelist.

.. code-block:: bash

    RewriteMap IP txt:/etc/apache2/whitelist
    Define PoshC2 10.0.0.1
    RewriteCond ${IP:%{REMOTE_ADDR}|NOT-FOUND} !NOT-FOUND
    RewriteRule ^/images/static/content/(.*) https://${PoshC2}/images/static/content/$1 [NC,P,L]
    ...

You have to do this for each rewrite rule you want to apply for each URL. In this case we are applying to the **/images/static/content/** path.

******************************
Whitelists and Domain Fronting
******************************

Another nuance is that if you are using Domain Fronting then the requesting IP will be that of the CDN provider, as they are making the request.
They will however, put the originating IP in the **X-Forwarded-For** header, and it is this IP that we also whitelist on:

.. code-block:: bash

    RewriteMap ips txt:/etc/apache2/whitelist.txt
    RewriteCond ${ips:%{REMOTE_ADDR}|NOT-FOUND} !NOT-FOUND [OR]
    RewriteCond ${ips:%{HTTP:X-Forwarded-For}|NOT-FOUND} !NOT-FOUND
    RewriteRule ^/images/static/content/(.*) https://${PoshC2}/images/static/content/$1 [NC,P,L]
    ...
