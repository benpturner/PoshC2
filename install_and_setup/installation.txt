Installation

PoshC2 is written in Python3 and developed and tested on Kali Linux. For this reason, it is recommended to run PoshC2 on Kali Linux to achieve the most stable results.
Alternatively, Docker images are provided which allow PoshC2 to be run on any host that supports Docker.

If you are using a host Anti-Virus/EDR it is recommended that you add an exclusion on the folder or location of the PoshC2 install and its project directory.

An install script is provided for installing PoshC2:

.. code-block:: bash

    *** PoshC2 Install script ***
    Usage:
    ./Install.sh -b <git branch> -p <Directory to clone PoshC2 to>

    Defaults are master branch to /opt/PoshC2

Elevated privileges are required as the install script performs `apt` updates and installations.

A bash one-liner is provided which curls down this script and executes it:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nettitude/PoshC2/master/Install.sh | sudo bash

Alternatively the repository can be cloned down and the install script manually run.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo ./Install.sh

You can manually set the PoshC2 installation directory by passing it to the Install.sh script as the `-p` argument. The default is **/opt/PoshC2**:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nettitude/PoshC2/master/Install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -p /root/PoshC2


*********************
Cutting Edge Features
*********************

We want to keep the `master` branch stable to ensure that users are able to rely on it when required and for this reason changes can often be feature-complete but not yet present on `master` as they have not been tested completely and signed-off yet.

If you want to look at upcoming features in PoshC2 you can check out the `dev` branch, or any individual feature branches branched off of `dev`.

As features **are** tested before they are merged into `dev` this branch should still be fairly stable and operators can opt in to using this branch or a particular feature branch for their engagement.
This does trade stablity for new features however so do it at your own discretion.

To use `dev` or a feature branch pass the branch name to the Install.sh script as the `-b` argument:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nettitude/PoshC2/dev/Install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -b dev


Note the URL includes the branch name also (here `dev` instead of `master`).

******
Docker
******

You can also run PoshC2 using Docker, this allows more stable and running and enables PoshC2 to easily run on other operating systems.

The Docker install does not clone PoshC2 as the PoshC2 images on Docker Hub are used, so only a minimal install of some dependencies and scripts are performed.

To start with, install Docker on the host and then add the PoshC2 projects directory to Docker as a shared directory if required for your OS. By default this is **/var/poshc2** on *nix.

Linux based hosts
=================

For *nix hosts, an install script is provided:

.. code-block:: bash

    *** PoshC2 Install script for Docker ***
    Usage:
    ./Install-for-Docker.sh -b <git branch>

    Default is the master branch


Elevated privileges are required as the install script performs script installations.

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nettitude/PoshC2/master/Install-for-Docker.sh | sudo bash


To use the `dev` or feature branches with Docker curl down the `Install-for-Docker.sh` on the appropriate branch and pass the branch name as an argument:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nettitude/PoshC2/BRANCHNAME/Install-for-Docker.sh | sudo bash -s -- -b BRANCHNAME
